# dotfiles

A collection of configuration files I use in my two most common desktop environments: Arch Linux & MacOS.

In terms of structure, I use the `stow` package in order to place these configs where they need to go. For example, in order to use the `zsh` config files, one would need to clone this repo to the home directory and use the following command:

```bash
stow zsh
```
